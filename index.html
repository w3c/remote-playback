    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that
        it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to expose the APIs defined in this
        specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification aims to make <a>remote playback devices</a> such as
        connected TVs, projectors or audio-only speakers, available to the Web and
        takes into account displays that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI,
        or similar) and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, or
        similar).
      </p>
      <p>
        Devices with limited screen size or quiet speakers lack the ability to
        playback media content to a larger audience, for example, a group of
        colleagues in a conference room, or friends and family at home. Playing media
        content on an external larger and/or louder <a>remote playback device</a> helps
        to improve the perceived quality and impact of the played media.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, this specification enables a page that acts as the <a>controller</a>
        to initiate and control remote playback of a particular media element on a selected
        <a>remote playback device</a>. How the remoting is initiated and controlled
        is left to the UA in order to allow the use of <a>remote playback devices</a> that
        can be attached in a wide variety of ways. For example, when a <a>remote playback device</a>
        is attached using HDMI or Miracast, the same UA that acts as the
        <a>controller</a> renders the remote media. Instead of playing the media on the same
        device, however, it can use whatever means the operating system provides for using
        the external <a>remote playback device</a>. In such a case, both the <a>controller</a> and
        the media player run on the same UA and the operating system is used to route the player
        output to the <a>remote playback device</a>. This is commonly referred to as the
        <dfn><b id="media-mirroring">media mirroring</b></dfn> case. This specification imposes no requirements on the
        <a>remote playback devices</a> connected in such a manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <a>remote playback device</a> is able to play the media and
        communicate with the <a>controller</a> but is unable to fetch the
        media, the <a>controller</a> needs to fetch the media data and pass
        it on to the <a>remote playback device</a> for rendering. This is
        commonly referred to as <dfn><b id="media-remoting">media remoting</b></dfn> case.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <a>remote playback device</a> is able to fetch and play the media and
        communicate with the <a>controller</a>, the <a>controller</a> does not
        need to fetch or render the remoted media. In this case, the UA acts as a proxy
        that requests the <a>remote playback device</a> to play the media itself by passing the necessary
        data like the media source. This is commonly referred to as the <dfn><b id="media-flinging">media flinging</b></dfn> case.
        This way of attaching to displays could be enhanced in the future by defining a standard protocol for
        delivering these types of messages that remote playback devices could choose to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API defined here is intended to be used with UAs that attach to
        <a>remote playback device</a> devices through any of the above means.

        Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section shows the code examples that highlight the usage of the main features of the Remote Playback API.
        In these examples, <code>player.html</code> implements the player page controlling the remote playback and
        <code>media.ext</code> is the media file to be played remotely. Both the page and the media are served from the
        domain <code>https://example.org</code>. Please refer to the comments in the code examples for further details.

            The <dfn><code>state</code></dfn> attribute represents the

            the values of <a>RemotePlaybackState</a> depending on the

          <ul dfn-for="RemotePlaybackState">

              <dfn>connecting</dfn> means that the user agent is attempting to

              This is the initial state when the <code>promise</code> returned by

              The local playback of the media element continues in this

          <p>
            The HTMLMediaElement interface interacts with the remotely played media
            as soon as the state of RemotePlayback has changed to "connected".
            All the media commands are sent to the remote playback device in order to change
            the state of the remotely played media while all the status updates received from
            the remote playback device are reflected on the HTMLMediaElement's state.
            If sending any command fails, the user agent stops remote
            playback and the state changes to "disconnected".
