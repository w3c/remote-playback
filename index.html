      <p>
        Although this document is still a <strong>work in progress</strong> and
        is subject to change, the Working Group believes that the API surface is
        stable. Most of the remaining issues listed on the <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/remote-playback/issues/">issue tracker</a> are
        considered minor at this stage except for

      <p>
        Issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/remote-playback/issues/41">#41</a>
        discusses the set of media playback features that remote playback
        devices are expected to support. The group will seek further developer
        feedback and implementation experience to identify any interoperability
        issues around these features when used during remote playback, and will
        further clarify the specification based on feedback received.

        The Second Screen Working Group will develop a test suite for the
        Remote Playback API during the Candidate Recommendation period and
        prepare an implementation report. For this specification to advance to
        Proposed Recommendation, two independent, interoperable implementations

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification aims to make <a>remote playback devices</a> such as
        connected TVs, projectors or audio-only speakers, available to the Web
        and takes into account playback devices that are attached using wired
        (HDMI, DVI, or similar) and wireless technologies (Miracast,
        Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, or similar).
      </p>
      <p>
        Devices with limited screen size or quiet speakers lack the ability to
        playback media content to a larger audience, for example, a group of
        colleagues in a conference room, or friends and family at home. Playing
        media content on an external larger and/or louder <a>remote playback
        device</a> helps to improve the perceived quality and impact of the
        played media.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, this specification enables a page that acts as the
        <a>browsing context</a> to initiate and control remote playback of a
        particular media element on a selected <a>remote playback device</a>.
        How the remoting is initiated and controlled is left to the UA in order
        to allow the use of <a>remote playback devices</a> that can be attached
        in a wide variety of ways. For example, when a <a>remote playback
        device</a> is attached using HDMI or Miracast, the same UA that acts as
        the <a>browsing context</a> renders the remote media. Instead of
        playing the media on the same device, however, it can use whatever
        means the operating system provides for using the external <a>remote
        playback device</a>. In such a case, both the <a>browsing context</a>
        and the media player run on the same UA and the operating system is
        used to route the player output to the <a>remote playback device</a>.
        This is commonly referred to as the <dfn>media
        mirroring</dfn> case. This specification imposes no requirements on
        the <a>remote playback devices</a> connected in such a manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <a>remote playback device</a> is able to play the media and
        communicate with the <a>browsing context</a> but is unable to fetch the
        media, the <a>browsing context</a> needs to fetch the media data and
        pass it on to the <a>remote playback device</a> for rendering. This is
        commonly referred to as <dfn>media remoting</dfn> case.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the <a>remote playback device</a> is able to fetch and play the media
        and communicate with the <a>browsing context</a>, the <a>browsing
        context</a> does not need to fetch or render the remoted media. In this
        case, the UA acts as a proxy that requests the <a>remote playback
        device</a> to play the media itself by passing the necessary data like
        the media source. This is commonly referred to as the <dfn>media
        flinging</dfn> case. This way of attaching to displays could be
        enhanced in the future by defining a standard protocol for delivering
        these types of messages that remote playback devices could choose to
        implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API defined here is intended to be used with UAs that attach to
        <a>remote playback device</a> devices through any of the above means.

      <p>
        This section shows code examples that highlight the usage of the main
        features of the Remote Playback API. In these examples,
        `player.html` implements the player page controlling the
        remote playback and `media.ext` is the media file to be
        played remotely. Both the page and the media are served from the domain
        `https://example.org`. Please refer to the comments in the
        code examples for further details.

          Common idioms

        <p>
          A <dfn>local playback device</dfn> is the device the <a>browsing
          context</a> is running on along with the default video/audio outputs
          the device has.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          A <a>local playback device</a> might have extra outputs, like an
          external display or speakers/headphones. As long as the switch of
          what output to use happens outside of the user agent on the
          system level, the playback is considered to happen on a <a>local
          playback device</a> for the purpose of this spec.
        </div>
        <p>
          A <dfn data-lt="remote playback devices">remote playback device</dfn>
          is any other device but the <a>local playback device</a> that the
          <a>browsing context</a> can use to play media on.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>media element state</dfn> is the set of all single
          <dfn data-cite="HTML#media-element">media element</dfn>
          properties observable by the page and/or the user via the
          user agent implementation. The new properties introduced by
          this spec are not considered part of the <a>media element state</a>
          for convenience.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          For example, the `paused` attribute or the pause/resume
          button reflecting that state on the default controls of the media
          element would be a part of <a>media element state</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          A <dfn>local playback state</dfn> is the user agent implementation of
          <a>media element state</a> for the particular <a>media element</a>
          for playback on the <a>local playback device</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>remote playback state</dfn> is the user agent implementation
          of <a>media element state</a> for the particular <a>media element</a>

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          For a good user experience it is important that the <a>media element
          state</a> doesn't change unexpectedly when the
          {{RemotePlayback/state}} changes. It is also important that <a>remote
          playback state</a> is in sync with the <a>media element state</a> so
          when the media is paused on the
          <a>remote playback device</a> it looks paused to both the user and

            </h5>
            <p>
              The user agent MUST keep a <dfn>list of available remote
              playback devices</dfn>. This list contains <a>remote playback
              devices</a> and is populated based on an implementation specific
              discovery mechanism. It is set to the most recent result of the
              algorithm to <a>monitor the list of available remote playback
              devices</a> or an empty list if the algorithm hasn't been run
              yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user agent MAY not support running the algorithm to
              <a>monitor the list of available remote playback devices</a>
              continuously, for example, because of platform or power
              consumption restrictions. In this case the promise returned by
              {{RemotePlayback/watchAvailability()}} MUST be rejected with
              {{NotSupportedError}}, the <a>global set of availability
              callbacks</a> will be empty and the algorithm to <a>monitor the
              list of available remote playback devices</a> will only run as
              part of the <a>initiate remote playback</a> algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the <a>global set of availability callbacks</a> is not
              empty, the user agent MUST <a>monitor the list of
              available remote playback devices</a> continuously, so that pages
              can keep track of the last value received via the registered
              callbacks to offer remote playback only when there are available
              devices.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              The user agent is expected not to <a>monitor the list of available
              remote playback devices</a> when possible, to satisfy the <a href=
              "https://github.com/w3c/remote-playback/blob/gh-pages/use-cases.md#power-saving-friendly">
              power saving non-functional requirement</a>. For example, the
              user agent might choose not to run the monitoring
              algorithm when the <a>global set of availability callbacks</a> is
              empty, when every page that has <a>media elements</a> with non-empty
              <a>set of availability callbacks</a> is in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some <a>remote playback devices</a> may only be able to play a
              subset of <a data-cite="HTML#media-resource">media resources</a>
              because of functional, security or hardware limitations. Examples
              are set-top boxes, smart TVs or networked speakers capable of
              rendering only certain formats of video and/or audio. We say that
              such a device is a <dfn>compatible remote playback device</dfn>
              for a <a data-cite="HTML#media-resource">media resource</a>
              if the user agent can reasonably guarantee that the
              remote playback of the media specified by the resource will
              succeed on that device.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              The user agent can use the {{HTMLTrackElement/srclang}}
              attribute of the <code>[^track^]</code> element as a hint of
              the language of the text track data to help identify a

              The <a data-cite="HTML#media-resource">media resources</a>
              of a <a>media element</a>, that were considered by the user agent
              to find a <a>compatible remote playback device</a>, are called the

              The <a data-cite="HTML#media-resource">media resource</a> of
              a <a>media element</a> that is used to <a>initiate remote
              playback</a> on the selected <a>remote playback device</a> is
              called the <dfn>remote playback source</dfn>.  A remote playback
              source MUST belong to the media element's <a>availability sources
              set</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mechanism to choose the <a>remote playback source</a> from
              the <a>availability sources set</a> is implementation-specific,
              but the user agent SHOULD consider every resource in
              the <a>availability sources set</a> as a potential <a>remote
              playback source</a>.

              The algorithm to select the <a>remote playback source</a> for a
              selected device depends on the user agent and supported <a>remote
              playback device</a> types. For example, in case of <a>media
              mirroring</a> the user agent can simply follow the
              {{HTMLMediaElement}}'s <a data-cite="HTML#concept-media-load-algorithm">
              resource selection algorithm</a>.  However, if <a>media

              source can depend on the selected <a>remote playback device</a>
              fetch and playback capabilities.
            </div>
            <p>
              If the user agent cannot determine a <a>remote playback source</a>
              appropriate for the <a>remote playback device</a>, it is
              RECOMMENDED that the user agent send metadata (for example,
              the <a data-cite="HTML#attr-source-type">extended MIME type</a>)
              about all resources in the <a>availability sources set</a> to
              the <a>remote playback device</a> so it can run its own
              <a data-cite="HTML#concept-media-load-algorithm">resource

              The <a>remote playback device</a> SHOULD implement all media

            </li>
            <li>
              The <a>remote playback device</a> SHOULD send updates of

              affect any attribute exposed through the <a>media element
              state</a>;
            <li>
              The user agent MUST process all updates of the

          </ul>
          <p>

            If the remote playback device is abruptly disconnected during

            available remote playback devices</a> before the steps to
            <a>disconnect from a remote playback device</a>.  This allows
            callbacks in the <a>set of availability callbacks</a> to be invoked
            before the {{RemotePlayback/disconnect}} event is fired, so the page can update

          <div class="note">
            The remote playback device might not actually stop playback of the

            In this case, stopping remote playback means that the user agent
            merely disconnects from the remote playback device and the

          also dependent on the user's local network context, so the risk is
          minimized.  Also, by design, the human readable name of a <a>remote

          The Remote Playback API abstracts away what "local" means for
          displays, meaning that it exposes network-accessible displays as
          though they were local displays. The Remote Playback API requires
